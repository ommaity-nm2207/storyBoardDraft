        <h1>Background and Inspiration</h1>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">I've been interested in Video Games for a really long time. As of lately, I've been extremely interested in interactive games because I've enjoyed the idea of the story shaping according to the decisions you make. I've been quite excited
          at the prospect of making my own small video game with some witty dialogue and allowing the user to try and explore all the different options presented to them.</h5>

        <p class="w3-text-grey">
          For inspiration, I've taken some ideas from a 2 games.

        <h1>Objectives</h1>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
          <p>I would like to make an interactive short story(more like a short teaser). There will be a few alternative pathways for the story to progress (currently looking at 2). 
            This will be the core and primary objective.</p>
          <p> If time permits, I would love to implement a feature which would let the user undo their actions so that they can explore more easily. A timer could also be added to the puzzle</p>

            <p>The dialogue which the user encounters will change depending on the input. The game will keep track of the sequence of inputs to change dialogue appropriately.</p>
            <p>The maze will require a use of a 2d array to create a list of possible moves. Functions will be added to keep track of the users progress through the maze, as well as determine any conditions for game over (e.g hit the wall)</p>
            <p>Since the game will require about 5 minutes per run, it might get frustrating to start the game from the beginning every time the page reloads. If time persists, I would like to implement a feature where the user can continue from where they left off (need to consult TA for what to learn for this feature)</p>

          <p><b>What is your project about?</b></p>
          <p>Drifting apart</p>
          <p><b>What is the data you plan to use?</b></p>
          <p>Since I'm doing a game instead of a datastory, I don't have a direct data set. My game is a short interactive story. Since there are multiple options, I will make my own data set with all the responses and followup options</p>
          <p><b>What is the question you plan to answer?</b></p>
          <p>Will the 2 characters remain close friends?</p>
          <p><b>Why is this an important question?</b></p>
          <p>I've personally drifted apart from many friends even though we've been close friends in the past</p>
          <p>Research has shown that past the 7th grade,<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797615588751">differences in compatability naturally lead to friendships dissolving</a></p>
          <p>However, all is not lost. It just means that people need to take more initiative and put in effort to keep a friendship alive.
            <a href="https://www.thezoereport.com/p/how-to-fix-a-friendship-thats-drifting-apart-according-to-a-relationship-expert-17027633">There are things people should try to do, and shouldn't do</a></p> 
          <p><b>How do you intend to explore this question?</b></p>
          <p>I've added a few different story paths so that the user can experience what it's like to see a friendship drifting apart. The different paths explore the different kinds of responses someone might have.</p>

          <p><b>Describe the interactions you intend to use</b></p>
          <p>I intend to let the user text Jake, the friend. However, since I want them to text the correct phrase, after they select the dailogue option, when they try to text, the message box will auto populate with the message on every key stroke</p>
          <p>I want the user to be able to click through the different contacts and read through their text log</p>
          <p>I want the user to try texting the password to the "AI" system, iris. It will advance the game depending on if the password is correct or not</p>
          <p>I want the user to be able to click on the profiles and access the profile pictures of all the 3 different contacts</p>
          <p><b>Attribute anything you plan to use from elsewhere</b></p>
          <p>Initially I wanted to attempt designing my own UI from scratch. After some trial and error, I decided that a template would serve me better. <a href="https://codepen.io/mubangadv/pen/rXrOQa">I found this template online</a>, however this template lacks any and all functionality. All interactions you see in my project were programmed in. There was no JS script in this template</p>
          <p>While not a direct 1-1 translation, I also <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_vertical_tabs.asp">referred to this page from w3schools</a> to make the tabs work </p>

          <p>They have to type in the password. The player obviously doesn't know the password, but this will encourage him to look through the messages to look for the password</p>
          <p>As the player reads the messages, they realise that they've drifted apart from their friends</p>
          <p>After finding the password, the player can try to message the friend, and try to either fix or worsen the relationship</p>
